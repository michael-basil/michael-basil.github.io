## Aikido & Zen

  * From fight to dance
* Conditioning
  * Stillness

* Harmonizing
  * Heart & Mind

## Four Principles of Ki

* Keep One Point
  * Think of your body like a tree, and your center is the strong roots. Keep your roots deep and steady, like the tree stays firm in the ground.
* Relax Completely
  * Imagine you're a ragdoll, all loose and floppy. Being relaxed helps you move smoothly and not get stuck.
* Keep Weight Underside
  * Balance your weight like a seesaw. Imagine your body is a teeter-totter, with your weight evenly spread on both sides.
* Extend Ki
  * Think of your energy like a warm hug. When you move, let your good vibes go outward, like spreading kindness to everyone around you.
