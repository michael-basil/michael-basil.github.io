*The **Prime Directive Is Learning**.  We do this by **Amplifying The Positive** whole **Embracing The Negative as Opportunities**.   With this balance we become gifted cyclists and surfers through the sea of change life offers in tension lines and waves.  We do well to **Bias Towards Don't Know Mind** and **Away From Discriminating Mind**.  Discriminating Mind can be quite useful, but tends to overly focus on carving up the world into good and bad, right and wrong when misapplied or left unchecked.  In essence, **Blame Game Delays Deep Learning**.*
