***Shin-shin kokoro do: true heart/mind way***

* Looking through lenses: 
  * Of the Mind, the ***Prime Directive is Learning***
  * Of the Heart, the ***Prime Allowance is Openness***
* In principle we we practice:
  * ***Amplifying The Positive***
  * ***Embracing The Negative as Opportunities***
* We strive for balance becoming:
  * ***Gifted Cyclists*** navigating life's tension lines
  * ***Skilled Surfers*** through life's infinite sea of change
* We do well to bias:
  * ***Towards Don’t Know Mind***
  * ***Away from Discriminating Mind***
* Recall:
  * ***Blame Game Delays Deep Learning***
  * We are: 
    * ***Bonded in the Heart***
    * ***Divided delusionally in the Mind***
